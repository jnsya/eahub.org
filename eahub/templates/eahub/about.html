        <h4>What we do</h4>
        <p>The EA Hub enables collaboration and facilitates connections between EAs to make it easier to learn, network, collaborate on projects, and find career opportunities. By improving community infrastructure projects, individuals, and groups, initiatives can build traction more effectively.</p>
        <p>To do this we:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Research, design &amp; build features needed by the community</li>
          <li>Work with other community building organisations to coordinate efforts and provide value where possible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Currently, we host global directories of individuals and groups and are working on other features to enable connections within the community.</p>

        <h4>For community members</h4>
        <p>Community members can use the <a href="http://eahub.org/profiles">Hub Community Directory</a> to create personal profiles and search for potential friends, mentors, speakers, employers, and collaborators. You can also use the <a href="http://eahub.org/groups">Hub Groups Directory</a> to connect with local, cause, career and affinity groups.</p>

        <p>This website is for you – its users! – and we are always looking to improve, so don’t hesitate to make suggestions, vote on new features and enhancements, or report bugs on our <a href="https://feedback.eahub.org/">feedback page</a>. Check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lj2lXidJOlha-rKjtZgzpnkOnb90GNDOT0NsfXAUTWI/edit#">FAQs</a> if you have any questions.</p>

        <h4>For community builders</h4>
        <p>We are working with a number of group organisers to help launch local group directories here on the Hub. If you’re interested in onboarding your group, we can help with mass uploading data (if you have the consent of your members), and we will consider feature requests to improve the directory for your local group.</p>

        <h4>For organisations</h4>
        <p>You can use the hub to search for and contact potential candidates for paid or voluntary roles.</p>
        <p>If you are an EA-aligned organisation and believe you could benefit from our data, please <a href="mailto:vaidehi@eahub.org"> contact Vaidehi, our Product Manager</a>.</p>

        <p>Our current and past collaborators include: CEA, GWWC, Rethink Priorities (on the EA Survey), One For The World (sharing data), EA Forum (sharing a data source and features) and Rethink Charity.</p>
        <p>The Hub is an open-source project, and we are keen to work with other EA tech initiatives whenever it makes sense to do so.</p>

        <h4>The Team</h4>
        <p>The Hub is an open-source project and has been contributed to and run by a team of volunteers:</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The EA Hub was originally created by Tom Ash in 2014 to host both his own projects (beginning with the <a href="https://www.rethinkprojects.org/easurvey">EA Survey</a> and the public <a href="https://eahub.org/profiles/">EA Profiles</a> that came out of it) and other independent ones. Tom's projects later moved to their own non-profit, .impact Focus Projects, which was <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/a3sScjxdgNTCseBMJ/impact-is-now-rethink-charity">renamed Rethink Charity</a> in 2017. The Hub is now fiscally sponsored by <a href="https://rtcharity.org/">Rethink Charity</a>, and run by our team of volunteers. </p>

        <p>The Hub was relaunched in 2019 by a team of staff and volunteers, and we would like to recognize the efforts of the following people who made this possible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Richenda Herzig: Product Manager and Illustrator</li>
          <li>Michal Trezsimiech: Project Manager</li>
          <li>Manoj Nathwani: Tech Lead/Back-End Developer</li>
          <li>Taymon Beal: Tech Lead/Back-End Developer</li>
          <li>Sebastian Becker: Front-End Developer</li>
          <li>Nadia Williams: Illustrator</li>
          <li>Piotr Cieszynski: Tester</li>
          <li>Alexander Herwix: Advisor</li>
        </ul>
